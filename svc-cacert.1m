.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/lib/svc/method/svc-cacert\fR

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBsvc-cacert\fR will be executed during systemboot by the \fBsmf\fR(5) service 
\fBsvc:/system/ca-certificates:default\fR, or if the administrator refreshes the service.
The service scans for root certificates in PEM format under /etc/certs/CA and creates symbolic
links from /etc/openssl/certs/ to the files.
It also generates a fresh /etc/curl/curlCA file, by concatenating the certificates.
